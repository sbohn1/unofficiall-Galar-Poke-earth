HTML from me, using various online recourses for references. 

Click on anywhere on a route to access the page, click on the diamond for a city, although the three main cities are more broad.

Since the Rose/Battle tower is two seperate items, click on the tower for Rose tower, and the dome for the battle tower.

All links send to Serebii.net, all credit goes to them.

All material portrayed is liscenced by Nintendo, all rights to them.

If Either Nintendo or Serebii are opposed to the existance of this map, I can remove it from the internet.

This was made soley independantly from both Nintendo and Serebii.

For use or any other purposes, please contact me at sgbohn1@gmail.com
